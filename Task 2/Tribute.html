He is well-known for founding the organization “Azad Hind Fauj,” and his slogan is “Tum Mujhe Khoon Do, Main Tumhe Azadi Dunga.” The burn injuries he sustained in a plane crash caused Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose to pass away on August 18, 1945, at a hospital in Taiwan. On January 23, 1897, he was born in Cuttack, Orissa. The most well-known liberation fighter, Subhash Chandra Bose possessed exceptional leadership qualities and was a charismatic orator. His slogans include “Delhi Chalo,” “tum mujhe khoon do,” and “main tumhe azadi dunga.” He established Azad Hind Fauj and made numerous contributions to the fight for India’s independence. He is renowned for his socialist policies as well as for the forceful tactics he utilized to win independence.<br>
